Jimmy is a motivated student at the University of Waterloo, currently pursuing Computer Science, Actuarial Science, with an interest in Data Science/Predictive Analytics. CS and Actsci are both very challenging subjects and that is precisely why he like studying them. He enjoys the freedom of having a million different ways to approach a problem in CS and the satisfaction from (hopefully) arriving at the most elegant solution. Jimmy also really appreciate the fact that Actsci is a field with a lot to accomplish, a lot of exams to pass, which means that there are lots of reasons to celebrate for as well. As you can see, he has a wide range of interests, but it doesn’t stop there. He also enjoys cooking and eating; in fact, his dream is to travel the world and try all the local specialties.
					</p>
					<p>
Jimmy has gotten a position as the event coordinator for the biggest Actuarial Science Club in Waterloo. He plans events in collaboration with other colleagues for a student body of around 125 people. His roles include contacting employers to host info sessions, bargaining with restaurants to provide food while following the club budget and promoting events to classes with the permission of professors.
					</p>
					<p>
Back in Jimmy’s high school, he was the co-president of his math club. He would typically lead weekly discussions on problem sets in collaboration with other executives. Members would explain their solution or their approach to a problem and the club would, as a group, dissect it; figure out what’s right, what’s wrong, and why is it right or wrong. In addition to overseeing weekly activities, he also plans and coordinates big events like year-end celebrations and presentations of key concepts that are useful on exams.
